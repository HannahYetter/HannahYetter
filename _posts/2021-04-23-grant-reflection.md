**Project Process**

I have always been interested in the French culture and language so when the time came to choose a subject for our grant project, I immediately knew I wanted to explore a facet of the French culture. I am a French major and have been studying the French language and culture for six years now, so I was excited to be able to do research on a topic that I found interesting. 

My first thought for the grant project was to focus on the French Revolution since that is a big part of French history. I originally wanted to catalog and map those who lost their lives during this important historical event. After talking to my professor, I realized that my original idea was way too broad for this project. I eventually narrowed my topic down to mapping and cataloging the deaths of Catholic Church officials during this time period, since it is not a topic widely discussed. I found projects that mapped certain elements of the French Revolution, but none that focused on mapping the deaths of Catholic officials. I think this element of the French Revolution is important to discuss because the Catholic Church influenced the Revolution in ways that are often overlooked.

Originally, it was difficult to find information for the Environmental Scan of my grant because I was specifically looking for research on the Catholic Church and its role in the French Revolution. At this point in the project, I was frustrated since my research was going poorly, and I was worried that I choose the wrong subject. I eventually broadened my research to encompass the entirety of the French Revolution and its historical moments. In doing this, I was able to find more sources that allowed me to elaborate on the cultural importance of the Revolution, and I instantly became less frustrated.

This project has not been easy for me, especially in the earlier stages. I struggled with differentiating what information goes in the Environmental Scan and what goes in the Grant Narrative. Every time I thought I understood what information went where, I would go to edit my documents and get confused all over again. What really helped me to finally understand where to put what information was a tweet posted by one of my classmates that explained that the Environmental Scan focuses on the “why” of a project and the Grant Narrative focuses on the “how” and “what”. This explanation simplified the complicated process of grant writing for me, and when I confuse myself, I often find myself looking back at that tweet for clarification.


**Class Reflection**

Writing the Environmental Scan, the Grant Narrative, and all the blog posts in this class has changed the way I view writing. I am accustomed to the long, analysis-driven papers that are often seen in English courses, and it was difficult to adjust my writing to fit better into the world of Digital Humanities. In the beginning, making my writing more concise while remaining professional was something I struggled with, but now that the class is over, I feel that I have made some improvement. It was hard to do because English classes engrain in students that the more verbose and technical the writing is, the better, while DH emphasizes a more easy-to-read approach to writing.

Before taking this class, I didn’t really know what DH was, but after starting the class, I realized that DH was larger than I had ever imagined. Now that the course is coming to a close, I feel like I have a better understanding of what encompasses DH. DH is hard to define, and I probably still couldn’t give a good definition of what I think it is, but after taking this course, I know how to recognize DH when I see it.

While looking at the list of classes to choose from, I read the DH course description and thought that it would be a good class to take to better articulate my writing in the vastly expanding digital age. I have never been good with technology, and I hoped that this class would not only expand my knowledge of writing, but of the technological world as well. Now that I have the opportunity to reflect on my experiences throughout the course, I would say that I have expanded my knowledge on both subjects. Never in a million years did I think I could write code, but the coding project ended up being one of my favorite assignments. I am very glad I decided to take this course, and I would encourage anyone who’s interested to take it as well.
