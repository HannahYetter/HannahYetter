Hello, my name is Hannah Yetter and I am a sophomore at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu).

I am currently a French major with a double minor in writing and international business, and after college my goal is to live and work in France to immerse myself in the language and culture. It has been a life-long goal of mine to be bilingual, so I am excited to see where my journey takes me. I've been studying French for about 6 years now.

Although I am a French major, I am interested in what the Digital Humanities can teach me, such as how to communicate on the internet more effectively and how to write and utilize aspects of coding. Technology has somewhat confounded me my entire life, so I am excited to learn more how to effectively apply certain aspects.

Over the summers I work as a full-time nanny from 7am to 6pm, but when I’m not working, I volunteer with my church [Prince of Peace](https://popparish.org) and their Serve the City program. Serve the City is a program where volunteers refurbish housing of those in need. Working with Serve the City has taught me many valuable lessons especially to never take what you have for granted.

I also occasionally volunteer with a school for autistic people called [Plan Bee Academy](https://www.planbeeacademy.org). Volunteering with Plan Bee is something close to my heart because my little brother is an alumnus and he has autism himself. Living with an autistic brother is not easy, but it has made me who I am today.

I chose Christopher Newport because I wanted to stay somewhat close to my family while also having some freedom at the same time. Christopher Newport is perfect for that because it’s only about an hour away from my hometown. I am a local to “the 757” (the area code of the Hampton Roads) and was born and raised in Chesapeake, Virginia.

My family is something that is _very_ important to me, which is why I didn’t want to be too far away from them (although I suppose if I move to France after college I will be **extremely** far away, but I’ll cross that bridge when I get to it).

I am an animal lover, and I have two myself that mean the world to me. I have a brown tabby cat named Prince and a black and tan miniature Australian shepherd dog named Stosh. I know Stosh is an abnormal name, but the only way I could convince my dad to let us get a dog was to let him name him, and that is what he came up with. Stosh’s stepbrother, Prince, is truly the sweetest cat I’ve ever known. He acts more like a dog than a cat, although he can be quite mischievous at times.

I hope this post has given you some insight on who I am as a person, and I cannot wait to learn more about the world of Digital Humanities!
