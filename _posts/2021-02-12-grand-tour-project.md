Stanford’s *The Grand Tour Project* is an exploration of the phenomena known as the Grand Tour of Italy. During the eighteenth century, Enlightenment thinkers undertook a voyage or “tour” of Italy to gain knowledge of humanist ideals and classical origins. This project studies the published and unpublished works of these travelers in order to re-create the paths they took and understand their exchange of ideas that influenced the modern world.

The Grand Tour Project draws much of its information from the *Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy 1701-1800* (the *Dictionary*). The *Dictionary* is comprised of 5213 entries that provide extensive information on those who undertook the Grand Tour. The project’s objective in digitalizing the contents of the *Dictionary* is to reveal who was in what place at what time and the overall travel trends.

While learning about the project through the “About the Project” page, I noticed a minor spelling inconsistency. Throughout the project the *Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy 1701-1800* is referenced as “the *Dictionary*”; however, in the last two paragraphs on the bottom of the “About the Project” page, it is referenced as “the *Dictionair*”. Other than the spelling mistake, the “About the Project” page was enlightening on what the project entails, and what exactly the Grand Tour of Italy is for those new to the subject.

There are many interactive elements to this project, such as graphs, maps, charts, and links, that make visualizing the Tours and their impact easy. 

The “Timechart of Travels” is one such interactive tool that meets the project’s objective of tracking who was in what place at what time. The timechart contains a lot of information, and the instructions on how to navigate through it are helpful and detailed. There is even a “search place” and “filter” option in case scholars or researchers need to access specific information quickly. As I was hovering over certain bars on the chart, I noticed instead of seeing the date when the tour was, I saw a backslash instead. Although the instructions are helpful for other information, they do not address what this backslash means.

Another interactive element of this project I found interesting was that titled “Map of travels with timespan filter”. This interactive map shows the cities most frequented on tours, with the bigger dots being cities more frequently visited. Seeing the size of the dots in comparison to others reveal which cities had the greatest impact on scholars at the time which allows modern scholars to view the overall travel trends. I am not sure if there is an issue with my computer, but I cannot see an outline of Italy when I view the map. I only see a blob of different sized dots that form something that resembles the shape of Italy. If the outline of Italy were incorporated, this map would be easier to read, and its impact would be much greater.

Overall, I think this project was very well informed and put together. The site was easy to navigate with links that worked and detailed instructions on how to use the interactive elements. Although there were a few minor errors, I think the project achieves its goal and puts together a detailed account of the “who,” “where,” and overall travel trends of the Grand Tour of Italy.
