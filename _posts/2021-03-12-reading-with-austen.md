**Introduction to the project**

*Reading with Austen* is a DH project that electronically recreates the library of Godmersham Park. Godmersham Park was the estate of Jane Austen’s brother Edward Austen Knight that he inherited upon the passing of his adoptive father. Each book in this digital library sits where it had when Jane Austen would visit to show exactly what Austen saw and read when studying in the library. This is important because it allows viewers to interact with works that influenced Austen the same way Austen did in the past.

The library is incomplete as of now, but the project developers are actively trying to find all the books to provide an accurate representation of the original library.


**Technology**

While I couldn’t find anywhere where the project developers talked about the specific technology behind the website, they did talk about how they created their digital catalogue. They explain that this catalogue was derived from a spreadsheet which included transcriptions of the catalogue speculation about matching volumes and other notes. Once they established which catalogue entries matched each work, they transcribed the page’s metadata (collecting information on the title, author, and publication date of each work). They are actively preparing this data for public use (including matching metadata standards and preparing documentation). 


**“About” Page**

Before I played with the interactive bookshelf, I went to the “About” page to learn more about the project. The "About" page provides lots of information on both the background of the Godmersham Park estate and its owners. While I appreciated all the background information, I did not appreciate how long it was. Despite being sectioned into parts, it was a lengthy read. It contained a lot of information on the background of the library and its owners, but not a lot of information on the project itself (such as the technology behind it), which is something I would have liked to see more of.


**Browsing the Library**

After learning about the original library on the “About” page, I went to the “Library” page to browse the books for myself. There are no instructions on how to navigate the library interactive feature, but it is relatively easy to figure out. The “East,” “South,” and “West” buttons take you to that enlarged section of the library where you can then click on “Left,” “Right,” or “Centre” for a closer look. No matter how you view the library, you can hover over books and get information such as their title, author, publication date, and more.

Depending on how zoomed in I was, this information was difficult to read, and the individual book placements on the shelves were especially hard to see. These issues were resolved the more you zoom into a certain section but looking at the library as a whole makes it difficult to see specifics. 

I liked the interactivity of the digital library tool, and it was interesting to see the shelves as Austen saw them. I also enjoyed how, whenever possible, the project developers made the cover of the spine on the digital shelves the actual cover of the spine of the original book. I think this element makes the experience more real since you get to see the exact book spine on its exact place in the shelf the same way Austen did.


**“Catalogue” Page**

After browsing the digital library, I looked through the “Catalogue” page, where each metadata for each work currently in the library can be found. The “Catalogue” page makes it possible to search for specific books on the shelf and provides more information than simply hovering over them. A brief paragraph above this tool explains that word order matters when searching for certain things. Without this explanation, I would have found this tool difficult to navigate. I enjoyed how this tool provided links to free websites where anyone can read the work online. This allows for more study into both the works themselves, and their influence on Austen’s own works.


**Concluding Thoughts**

Overall, I thought the project was very well done. It is aesthetically pleasing, historically accurate, and contains details that makes the experience more personal for those interested in the works that influenced Jane Austen.
