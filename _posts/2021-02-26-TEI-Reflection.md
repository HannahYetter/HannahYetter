I was assigned pages 32-35 of Charlotte Perkins Stenson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper” to code using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). “The Yellow Wall-paper” is a work that draws on some of Stenson’s own personal experiences with “medical” treatments of mental problems in the late 1800s. I was tasked with using Oxygen XML (eXtensible Markup Language) to markup and code the pages I was assigned.

Before jumping straight into Oxygen, I was provided a Google Document with my portion of the story. There I was able to take note of certain important features such as quotations to essentially pre-markup markup my text. This was made easy by use of the Google Document comments feature. I spent more time on this part than I anticipated I would because I was paranoid that I would miss something crucial that would be integral to my code. As a result, I made a lot of comments on my section. Looking back, I think that I could have gone about this part differently. For example, I highlighted the beginning and end quotation marks instead of simply highlighting the whole quotation. Despite making more work for myself, the comments I made in the Google Document were still sufficient in preparing me for Oxygen.

My section of Stenson’s work had a lot of quotes, and as I was commenting on them in the Google Document, all I could think about was how difficult it would be to code them all in Oxygen. The number of quotes and the thought of having to code them all made me nervous since I am notoriously bad with technology.

My family members, however, are technology gods in comparison. My mom writes code for a living, and my brother has written his own code that allows him to bypass his WIFI limitations (something I didn’t even know was possible). 

I am only an hour drive from home, so last weekend I went home with the intention of writing my code and having my mom look over it once I was done. When I first opened Oxygen, I was overwhelmed, but I went through and watched the recording my professor posted online (which was super helpful) and in no time I found myself getting the hang of things.

I did ask my mom the occasional question when I wasn’t sure why my code was invalid, and sometimes her answers contained so much technological lingo that I was still left confused. I remember she told me to “cut” something, and I immediately highlighted it and hit the delete key. She started laughing because apparently “cut” and “delete” are two different things.

Despite the few questions I had here and there and my lack of technological expertise, I found Oxygen surprisingly easy to navigate. I am very detailed oriented, as is my mom, and I quickly realized that this attribute is essential in writing valid code. By the time I had finished my code, I was very proud of myself, and I was able to finally understand why my mom enjoys coding so much.

Overall, I found myself surprised with how much I enjoyed this project. My experience with Oxygen has taught me to be less afraid of the coding/technology world, and to have more confidence when it comes to my own technological abilities.
